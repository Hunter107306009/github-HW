<h1>My self introduction</h1>
<body>
	My name is Hunter, and I`m from National Chengchi University. 
	In terms of personal qualities, I am a student with excellent self-discipline. This advantage is attributed to the self-education at home that I received during primary school. Self-study at home provides me more free time to use, but how is it in my leisure? To achieve a good balance with schooling is the challenge that I need to face alone. Because there is no school teacher and the persecution of the exam, I must learn to be responsible for myself and self-monitoring from an early age. In addition, I am also a curious young person. This character is not only reflected in my desire for learning, but also leads to personal characteristics that I love to take risks. I like to step out of the comfort zone of life and discover my possibly, I used to travel to Kaohsiung alone to travel by myself. I also participated in the challenge of riding a bicycle around the island. Last year I left Taiwan and volunteered for a one-week journey in Guizhou, China.
